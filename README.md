This project based on Ice Cream Sales prediction using pytorch

In this, we used libraries of pandas,sklearn,matplotlib and mainly pytorch for data processing model usage of linearRegression model.

starting stage we have taken a dummy dataset for that data set data visualization is given below

After training the LinearRegression model with the loss function and gradient descent for forward propagation and backward propagations
Then final visualization with the true of blue color and predictions of red color  given below
